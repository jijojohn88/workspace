Palindrome 
 - divide the string in the middle and traverse from middle to end/start , and compare each position 
 - Palindrome mid point can be only 1 or 2 points. run the same palindrome check method for both the conditions with the mid point repeating for , 1 point palindrome

SameTree
 - use recursion to traverse left and right at the same and return boolean and do && on them so that if one of them fails it will make everything false.

TwoSum
 - use hashmap to store the ($target - $number) - if its present return the indices. 

LongestSubstring with out repeating chars 
 - maintain start and end indices 
 - use a hashset to store the current string in progress
 - if the set doesnot contain keep adding to the set and increment the end operator
 - else - increment the start index 
        - remove the First char alone from the set 
        - using the same end char check the set again if it still has the repeating char then keep repeating the else 
 - return the max length found so far. 

Island problem [ https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/submissions/ ]
       - iterate the entire Matrix
       - call dfs to check the next 4 neighbors of the cell is 1 or 0.
       - sink the current node to make sure its again iterated
       - always ignore the value 0 as we are only interested in value 1
